## üöÄ How to Run

This application is containerized and available on Docker Hub. The easiest way to run it is using Docker.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose installed.
-   A Telegram Bot Token from BotFather.
-   A running MongoDB instance.
-   An API key from a provider like Wallex.

### Running with Docker

1.  Create a `.env` file in your directory with the following content:

    ```env
    TELEGRAM_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN"
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://your_mongo_user:your_mongo_password@your_mongo_host:27017/"
    DB_NAME="crypto_bot_db"
    API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

2.  Pull the image from Docker Hub and run it using the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name crypto-bot --env-file ./.env rezagp/crypto-telegram-bot:latest
    ```

### (Recommended) Running with Docker Compose

For an easier setup that includes a MongoDB service, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file.

1.  Create the `.env` file as described above.
2.  Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
This will start both the bot and a dedicated MongoDB container.
